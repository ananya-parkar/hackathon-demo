    "query": "what are the different leaves available to the employees according to the handbook?",
    "answer": "According to the Employee Handbook_V3.pdf (Page 1), there are at least three types of leaves available to employees:\n\n1. Compensatory Off: This leave is granted in case an employee works on holidays or over the weekends for a business need.\n2. Maternity Leave: This leave is available to female employees, and it can be availed in conjunction with other leaves. However, Maternity Leave is not en-cashable.\n\nAdditionally, the handbook mentions that there are other types of leaves available, but they are grouped under \"Un-Authorized Leaves\" on page 1 of the PDF. These include:\n\n* Leaves beyond the available balance without prior approvals\n* Leaves taken for reasons such as death in the family or medical emergencies (not specifically mentioned with a name)\n\nIt's also worth noting that the handbook mentions that employees do not need to apply for leave in certain situations, such as when they are on Compensatory Off or Maternity Leave. However, it does require prior approval and submission of medical reports from a registered medical practitioner for Maternity Leave.\n\nOverall, while the exact nature and specifics of other types of leaves are not clearly stated, the handbook provides some information about three distinct types of leave: Compensatory Off, Maternity Leave, and Un-Authorized Leaves.",

    "query": "what is the certification policy",
    "answer": "The certification policy at Parkar ensures that employees can obtain external training and certifications to achieve functional excellence. According to this policy, employees must obtain prior approvals for certification, including taxation.\n\nBefore enrolling in a certification program, employees are required to initiate discussions with their supervisors. The company will only cover the certification fee for a single attempt, but not expenses related to training, tuition, books, study materials, or coaching.\n\nThe policy also allows associates to apply for multiple certifications within a year, based on business needs. However, it reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any provisions of the policy at its discretion.",
